# Zetamarkets

This project is intended to be a python SDK for `Zetamarkets` suite of tools. It is a loose port of the 
[Zetamarkets Javascript SDK](https://github.com/zetamarkets/sdk)

Please **Don't** use this project at the moment as it is a work in progress. We'll see how far we get at the end of the Solana Hackathon which is currently ongoing.
